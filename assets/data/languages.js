      SARS IS KILLING US. 
      
      They are killing us for pressing phone and having laptops. They are collecting our small salaries, your allowances and all our life savings. They are making us live in fear. 
      We know you don't want this to happen, you want to reap the fruit on your labor on us. That is why we are begging you to help us, help us #EndSars. Support us by calling those you know in power to #EndSars
      Support our protests to #EndSars and put an #EndToPoliceBrutality.
      
      Send this message to 5 other parents who care about their children.`,
    `Do you work so hard so that your children would have to cower in fear for their lives at the hands of those who should protect them? 
    Do you want to continue to live in fear that one day your child would be arrested and you'd have to start running from pillar to post to make sure they don't suffer the inhumane conditions of the Nigerian police cell? 
    Do you want to continue to part with the money you have worked so hard for to pay for bail for non-existent offences? 
    Do you want to continue to work yourself into the ground trying to get your children out of Nigeria because you know that they are not safe here?
    
    Nobody wants any of these. Please support our calls for a total #EndToPoliceBrutality in Nigeria.`,
    `A few days ago, a young man, JIMOH ISIAQ was shot and killed by a police officer in Ogbomoso at the #ENDSARS protest in Ogbomoso and has been buried but mainstream media is trying to debunk the story.
    This is one of many young people whose lives have been cut short.
    
    Mainstream media is not carrying the news as it ought to, and a large number of them are spreading the wrong message. We are aware a lot of our parents are not on social media so we are sending this to keep you in the loop. That is why we are appealing to you to help us #EndSars now before it gets too late.
